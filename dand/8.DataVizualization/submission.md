[Tableau Workbook](https://public.tableau.com/profile/toni.jung#!/vizhome/DAND-TableauProject-TitanicData/Dashboard1?publish=yes)

**Summary**: I used the [**Titanic**](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/October/59d54e6d_titanic-data/titanic-data.csv&sa=D&ust=1509207161543000&usg=AFQjCNHqH9JRe47RFULviO6Cs8-aKwa7fQ) dataset. In the top left visualization we see that average fare is highest for females who traveled in the top class of rooms onboard the Titanic. On the bottom left we confirm that overall females on average paid more for their fare but overall more males survived. On the right we see that females in all classes had higher survival rates than males in all classes and that class by class males were on average older. 

**Feedback**: Praised for using colors other than black and blue. Asked to add fare mark labels.

**Resources**: Udacity DAND videos.

**Data Files**: Everything is linked in this markdown file.
