**Summary**: I used the [**Titanic**](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/October/59d54e6d_titanic-data/titanic-data.csv&sa=D&ust=1509207161543000&usg=AFQjCNHqH9JRe47RFULviO6Cs8-aKwa7fQ) dataset. 
We explore the demographics of Titanic riders. We showed that there were more men, that overall females on average paid more for their fare, and on average females had higher survival rates.

**Design**: I chose to use mostly bar charts because the interesting variables are categorical: female/male, survived/not survived, class 1/2/3, etc. Based on feedback from Version 1 (see below), I changed the Dashboard into a story and cleaned up my charts by displaying less information and adding legends when appropriate. 

**Feedback**: 

[Version 1]: Should be a Tableau Story not Dashboard. Charts need to be less complicated and include legends. 

[Version 2]: Praised for telling the simple story and easy to digest figures. Impressive storytelling technique. Good job for telling a narrative through the visualizations. The visualizations are very engaging and communicative.

[Version 3]: The charts to a good job reinforcing the Titanic's evacution story of "women and children first."
