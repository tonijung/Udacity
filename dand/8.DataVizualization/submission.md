**Summary**: I used the [**Titanic**](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/October/59d54e6d_titanic-data/titanic-data.csv&sa=D&ust=1509207161543000&usg=AFQjCNHqH9JRe47RFULviO6Cs8-aKwa7fQ) dataset. 
We explore the demographics of Titanic riders. We showed that there were more men, that overall females on average paid more for their fare, and on average females had higher survival rates.

**Feedback**: Praised for telling the simple story and easy to digest figures. 

**Resources**: Udacity DAND videos.

**Data Files**: Everything is linked in this markdown file.
