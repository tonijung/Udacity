Step Into a Data Analyst's Shoes
In this project, you’ll conduct an overview of what a data analyst does regularly. You'll investigate a raw dataset and share your findings using a Jupyter Notebook. Using real-life data provided by Bay Area Bike Share, you will determine differences in usage between commuters and tourists' ridership patterns, average duration of trips, and more!

The steps you take in this project will be taught in more depth throughout the program. By the time you graduate, you’ll be equipped with a diverse set of skills to help you tackle a wide variety of data analysis problems.

Data analysts collect, organize, study, and present data in order to answer interesting questions and aid in decision making. At Udacity, the Data Team helps decide the pricing of Nanodegree programs, figure out the right timing to send emails, and surfaces the list of students who are close to graduation, and much more!
